**I completed all of the necessary user stories below:
**

- I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
- title url link description rating (1-5)

- I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

- All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

- Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

- I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

- Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required) I can select from a dropdown (a element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection (Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
